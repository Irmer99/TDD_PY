# Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Python and pytest

This project demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Python and the `pytest` framework.

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Project Root**

  Open your terminal and change directory to the parent folder where the Python virtual environment is located:

  ```sh
  cd ..
  ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

  On Windows, activate the virtual environment with:

  ```sh
  ..\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. **Run Tests with pytest**

  Since `pip` and `pytest` are already installed, you can run your tests using:

  ```sh
  pytest
  ```

## Workflow

- Write a failing test.
- Implement the minimum code to pass the test.
- Refactor the code while keeping tests green.

Repeat this cycle to build robust, well-tested Python code.
