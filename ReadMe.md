# Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Python and pytest
## Authors
**Ayenya and Gift**

This project demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Python and the `pytest` framework. It is the python version of the assignment.

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Project Root**

  Open your terminal and change directory to the parent folder where the Python virtual environment is located(I added it in the parent folder, less cluttering):

  ```sh
  cd ..
  ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

  On Windows, activate the virtual environment with(used `..` since the that's where I made the virtual environment):

  ```sh
  ..\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. **Run Tests with pytest**

  Since `pip` and `pytest` are already installed in the parent directoy, you can run your tests using:

  ```sh
  pytest
  ```

## Workflow: Test first

- We wrote our tests using assert.
- Implemented the function to pass the test.
- Refactor the code while keeping tests green.

## Single test
We added an overall test in the **.vscode folder/settings.json** that allows to do single tests. (we tried implementing it in Javascript)
